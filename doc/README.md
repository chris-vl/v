VCoin Core 0.12.1
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[VCoin Core](http://vcoin.org/en/download) is the original VCoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of VCoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run VCoin on your native platform.

### Unix

You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run VCoin-Qt. On Debian or Ubuntu:

	sudo apt-get install libqtgui4

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/vcoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/vcoind (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/vcoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/vcoind (headless, 64-bit)



### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run vcoin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag VCoin-Core to your applications folder, and then run VCoin-Core.
